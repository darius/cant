;; exports: start stop wait signal

;; This example is interesting in that the state I'd at first think of
;; as naturally living in the server processs (i.e. the list of
;; processes waiting on the mutex) is not represented in the server
;; loop's state arguments -- it's implicit in the process mailbox
;; instead.
