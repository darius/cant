;; "Maximum subsegment sum" problem:
;; Given a list of numbers, find the greatest sum of any slice of it.
;; (Since an empty slice has sum 0, the max can't be any less.)

;; Brute force method:
(to (mss-naive ns)
  (max @(each sum ns.slices)))

;; Kadane's O(n) algorithm:
(to (mss ns)
  (max @(for amassing [(ssum 0) (n ns)]
          (max 0 (+ ssum n)))))

;; Test case from Rosetta code
(for each! [(example '((-1 -2 3 5 6 -2 -1 4 -4 2 -1)))]
  (yo (mss-naive example))
  (yo (mss example)))
