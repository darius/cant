Problems from a certain site that asks you not to post solutions. I'm
not complying, but to at least make this not gratuitously google, I
won't name the site. Let's say it sounds like "pro checked oiler".

If you find that site, then e.g. 01.cant corresponds to their problem
#1. I would normally copy the problem statements as comments for each
file, but see above.

Obviously, if you want to try the problems yourself, skip these files
for spoilers.
