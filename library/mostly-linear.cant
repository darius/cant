;; Solve mostly-linear systems of equations, a la Van Wyk's IDEAL.

;; Constraints are equations between expressions. We represent one as

;; to a linear combination of variables plus a constant, then
;; eliminate one of the variables, and continue. Nonlinear expressions
;; get put off to try again later.
