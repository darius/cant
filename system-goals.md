## OK, but can't you list some vague aspirations and utopian priorities?

I want hacking in this system to make me happy, so that I'm itching to
get back to the computer. What makes me happy?

* Clear understanding.

* Pretty code.

* Rapid feedback.

* Simple design -- feeling like a know-it-all.

* Code that works the first time.
  (This is in tension with "rapid feedback", yeah.)

* Feeling like an augmented intellect. Getting out seemingly more than
  I put in.

What makes me unhappy?

* Filling out forms. 

* Needing permission.

* Unpleasant surprises.

* Feeling puzzled without good reason.

Priorities. Cant should:

1. Help you to understand the behavior of programs. This might be for
explorable explanations, or for debugging and development. Understanding can
include what changes when you change the code.

Thus:

* Determinism. (Cf. the importance of replication in science.)

* Time travel.

* Easy prettyprinting of everything.

* Live update of code.

* Halp.

* (what else?)

2. Be itself understandable, as an explorable explanation of
computing.

3. Run some useful programs well. This is only the third priority;
most systems don't elevate the first two priorities above it. OTOH
there are educational systems like Little Smalltalk (a good one!)
which I'm not sure have ever run a program for actual use.

A goal that emerged: everyday tasks should go naturally in clear
concise code. Since this quality comes mainly from library design, the
language should enable a stdlib which supports it. (But vastly
complicated external standards like HTML are out of scope, however
'everyday' they are in our fallen world.)
